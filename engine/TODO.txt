- Systems should be able to register and call events
- Assert -> better string format support
- GL objects dont check binds before binding themselves, or do any unsettings / bind undos (Not sure if needed)
- Not sure if texture slots work as intended, need to test
- Sprite drawing order is based on sorting order, causes flickering when drawing new objects
- Injection of scene manager / asset manager into systems global / scene ones is duplicate code
- Refactor pushEvent injections
- tilemaps should retrieve tilemap width and height internally
- Line rendering for debug purposes
- Input handling
- Maybe remove layers overall (?)
- Put physics into new namespace
